# python_evs_automation
EVS Automation API for Python

# Overview
The evs_automation Python package allows for the automation 
of [Earth Volumetric Studio](https://www.ctech.com/products/earth-volumetric-studio/), 
a commercial product of [C Tech Development Corporation](https://ctech.com). 

This library provides a workflow for controlling EVS from any Python 3 environment. 
Care has been taken to enable the same functionality as internal Python API, as well
as additional features specifically intended to function from automated workflows.

# Features

- **Process Management**: Start new, or connect to existing EVS processes, and automate actions
- **Full EVS Python API**: The evs.* python functions have all been ported, so scripts written inside EVS can be migrated to work via automation with few, minor changes.
- **New API Additions**: Additional API functions are availble, including loading .evs applications, running existing Python scripts, and shutting down EVS

# Requirements

- Python 3 (3.10 or later suggested. Anaconda recommended.)
- Earth Volumetric Studio, Version 2024.9.1 or later

### Required Packages:
- pywin32
- psutil
- packaging

# Quick Start

Here's a simple example to start:

```python
import evs_automation

try:
    # Launch a new EVS process
    with evs_automation.start_new() as evs:
        # Load an application
        evs.load_application('C:\\Projects\\my application.evs')

        # Note that the syntax below is identical to the interal EVS Python script syntax
         
        # Instance a titles module and set the title
        newmodule = evs.instance_module('titles', 'titles', 363, 679)
        evs.connect(newmodule, 'Output Object', 'viewer', 'Objects')
        evs.set_module(newmodule, 'Properties', 'Title', 'Title added from script')
        evs.set_module(newmodule, 'Positioning', 'Anchor Side', 0)

        # Execute a Python script
        evs.execute_python_script('C:\\Projects\\export_data.py')

        # EVS (by default) will shut down at this point automatically
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Received exception : {e}")```
```
